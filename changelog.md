So I just found api_dump_index.json. 

Each API has a full json dump.
Why am I trying to parse HTML changelogs if there are json dumps?

Haven't looked into it too much yet but oh this is lovely. I'm sure https://docs.blender.org/api/2.92/api_dump.json isn't meant to be reading material but I love it.
