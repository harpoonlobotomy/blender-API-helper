# changelog

## 8/11/25
The JSON dump getter/cleaner is updated with args and version selection. Provided source + target versions, it'll get+clean those api dumps.
Really this feels very home-baked; it feels like it should be a remote resource. But this wil do for now. idk, I like the idea of just downloading+cleaning them once and then carrying on from there. But will see. If I can get it working at all it'll be a miracle, so I'm not too worried about the theoretical ideal just yet.

So I just found api_dump_index.json. 

Each API has a full json dump.
Why am I trying to parse HTML changelogs if there are json dumps?

Haven't looked into it too much yet but oh this is lovely. I'm sure https://docs.blender.org/api/2.92/api_dump.json isn't meant to be reading material but I love it.
